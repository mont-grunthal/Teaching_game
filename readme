This is just a little teaching demonstration I put together with my girlfriend
to teach her the usefulness of hash maps in certain situations. The two rock.py
files are implementations of a rock, paper, scissors console game. The first
uses a large elif block to determine the winner and the second uses a python
dictionary. Comparison.py runs each rock.py game 10000000 times and reports the
difference in speed between the two implementations.

After having her take the lead on implementing the game and displaying the
difference in speed we were able to significantly improve her
understanding of python programming*.

*The improvement in understanding was reported by someone who loves me
so there is a very real chance the results were skewed by that fact.
In any case, I had fun.
